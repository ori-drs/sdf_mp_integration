sdf_mp_integration
===================================================

This package performs integrates fast distance field computations (gpu_voxels_ros) with whole-body motion planning using a trajectory optimisation approach. 
This package inlcudes an implementation of the Receding Horizon and Predictive Gaussian Process Motion Planner 2 (RHAP-GPMP2), as presented in Finean2022 listed below.
